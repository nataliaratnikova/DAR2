V2_0_0_pre3 :  refdbdar tested with request  #107 (OSCAR_3_9_8).

Minor changes compare to  V2_0_0_pre2:
 bin/refdbdar        - allow relative path in second argument (tmpdir)
 src/DAR/Packager.py - Removed architecture from  the versiontag name. 
                       This rudimental feature was used when dar did 
                       not have an architecture directory sublevel 
 doc                 - temporarily removed until update is ready
